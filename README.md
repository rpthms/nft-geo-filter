# nft-geo-filter
Allow/deny traffic in nftables using country specific IP blocks

# Requirements
This script requires nftables >= 0.9.0

# Installation
Download the script from here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpthms/nft-geo-filter/master/nft-geo-filter

# TL;DR
Run `nft-geo-filter --table-family netdev --interface <interface_to_internet>
XX` to block packets from the country whose ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code is
XX. Replace `<interface_to_internet>` with the interface name in your system
that's connected to the internet (Eg:- eth0).

# Description
This script will download IPv4 or/and IPv6 blocks for the specified countries
from one of the supported IP blocks provider and add them to sets in the
specified table. You have to provide 2 letter ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country codes
of the countries you want to filter as positional arguments to this script.

nft-geo-filter supports three IP Blocks provider at this point:

* **ipverse.net** - http://ipverse.net/
* **ipdeny.com** - https://www.ipdeny.com/ipblocks/
* **MaxMind GeoIP2 and GeoLite2** - https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data

You can specify which table holds the sets and the filtering rules using the
`--table-family` and `--table-name` flags. `--table-name` specifies the name of
the table. nft-geo-filter requires its own private table, so make sure that the
table name that you provide is not being used by any other table in your
ruleset. `--table-family` specifies the family of the nftables table which will
store the filter sets and the filtering rule. The family must be one of the
following options:

* ip
* ip6
* inet
* netdev

By using a separate table, this script can create it's own chains and add its
own filtering rules without needing the admin to make any changes to their
nftables config, like you were required to do in the previous version of this
script. **Do not add any rules to the chains inside nft-geo-filter's private
table**, because they will be removed when you re-run the script to update the
filter sets.

**The default action of this script is to block traffic** from the IP blocks of
the provided countries and allow everything else. To invert this behaviour and
only allow traffic from the IP blocks of the specified countries (with a few
exceptions, see the "Allow mode exceptions" section below), use the `--allow`
flag.

Running nft-geo-filter without specifying any optional flags will end up
creating IP sets and filtering rules to block traffic from those IPs, inside a
table called 'geo-filter' of the 'inet' family. But **it is recommended to use
a 'netdev' table to drop packets** much more effeciently than the other
families.  Refer to the 'netdev' section below.

# IPv4 or IPv6?

The filter sets that are added to the table is determined by the table's family
that you specify using `--table-family`:

Table Family | Filter Sets
-------------|------------
ip|Only the IPv4 set
ip6|Only the IPv6 set
inet|Both IPv4 and IPv6 sets
netdev|Both IPv4 and IPv6 sets by default. Use the --no-ipv6 flag to only use the IPv4 set or the --no-ipv4 flag to only use the IPv6 set.

# Netdev
Using the netdev table to drop packets is more efficient than dropping them in
the tables of other families (by a factor of 2x according to the nftables wiki:
https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Nftables_families#netdev).
This is because the netdev rules are applied very early in the packet path (as
soon as the NIC passes the packets to the networking stack).

To use a netdev table, you need to set the `--table-family` to `netdev` and
provide the name of the interface that's connected to the internet by using the
`--interface` flag. The interface is needed because netdev tables work on a
per-interface basis.

# Allow mode implicit exceptions
When you use `--allow`, certain rules are automatically added along with the
regular filtering rules to ensure that your regular traffic is not impeded.
These rules ensure that:

1. Traffic from private IPv4 address ranges and link-local IPv6 address ranges
are allowed to pass through.
2. Traffic from the localhost is allowed to pass through.
3. Non-IP traffic such as ARP is not blocked when using the netdev table.

# Allow outgoing connections to denied IPs
In case you want to make connections to IP addresses that are being denied by
the filtering sets, you can use the `--allow-established` flag. This will add a
rule to the filter-chain to allow packets from all established and related
connections (i.e the first packet of the connection should originate from your
host). Initial packets from the denied IPs will always be denied.

This flag is really handy when combined with `--allow`, which lets you limit
the incoming connections to certain countries while letting you create outgoing
connections to any country without any restrictions. Check the example titled
'Only allow incoming packets from Monaco but still allow outgoing connections
to any country' in the section below to get an idea about the
`--allow-established` flag.

# Manual exceptions
You can create exceptions for a few IP addresses so that they pass through the
filtering sets that were set up. To do that provide a comma separated list of
IPs that need to be exempted from filtering to the `--exceptions` flag. This
will create rules that would explicitly allow packets from the specified IP
addresses, even if the filtering sets would block them. Check the "Usage
examples" section below to see how the `--exceptions` flag can be used.

# What do I need to add to my nftables config?
**Nothing!** Since this script creates a separate nftables table to filter your
traffic, it will not cause your current nftables config to break. The
"filter-chain" chain created by this script has a high priority of -190 to
ensure that:
* Conntrack operations happen before this script's rule matching begins
(Connection tracking operations uses a higher priority of -200)
* Filtering rules of this script are applied before your own
rules (Most people won't be using a filter chain with such a high priority)

# Other options
By default, nft-geo-filter uses `/usr/sbin/nft` as the path to the nft binary.
If your distro stores nft in a different location, specify that location using
the `--nft-location` argument.

You can also add counters to your filtering rules to see how many packets have
been dropped/accepted. Just add the `--counter` argument when calling the
script.

Filtering rules can also log the packets that are accepted or droped by them, by
using the `--log-accept` or the `--log-drop` arguments. You can optionally provide
a prefix to the log messages for easier identification, using the `--log-accept-prefix`,
`--log-drop-prefix` arguments and change the log severity level from 'warn' by using
 the `--log-accept-level` and `--log-drop-level` arguments.

# Help text

Filter traffic in nftables using country IP blocks

positional arguments:
  country               2 letter ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country codes to
                        allow/block. Check your IP blocks provider to find the
                        list of supported countries.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         show verbose output
  --version             show program's version number and exit

  -l LOCATION, --nft-location LOCATION
                        Location of the nft binary. Default is /usr/sbin/nft
  -a, --allow           By default, all the IPs in the filter sets will be
                        denied and every other IP will be allowed to pass the
                        filtering chain. Provide this argument to reverse this
                        behaviour.
  --allow-established   Allow packets from denied IPs, but only if they are a
                        part of an established connection i.e the initial
                        packet originated from your host. Initial packets from
                        the denied IPs will still be dropped. This flag can be
                        useful when using the allow mode, so that outgoing
                        connections to addresses outside the filter set can
                        still be made.
  -c, --counter         Add the counter statement to the filtering rules
  --provider {ipdeny.com,ipverse.net,maxmind}
                        Specify the country IP blocks provider. Default is
                        ipverse.net
  --maxmind-zip MAXMIND_ZIP
                        If using the maxmind provider, path to the 'GeoLite2
                        Country: CSV Format' zip

Table:
  Provide the name and the family of the table in which the set of filtered
  addresses will be created. This script will create a new nftables table,
  so make sure the provided table name is unique and not being used by any
  other table in the ruleset. An 'inet' table called 'geo-filter' will be
  used by default

  -f {ip,ip6,inet,netdev}, --table-family {ip,ip6,inet,netdev}
                        Specify the table's family. Default is inet
  -n NAME, --table-name NAME
                        Specify the table's name. Default is geo-filter

Netdev arguments:
  If you're using a netdev table, you need to provide the name of the
  interface which is connected to the internet because netdev tables work on
  a per-interface basis. You can also choose to only store v4 or only store
  v6 addresses inside the netdev table sets by providing the '--no-ipv6' or
  '--no-ipv4' arguments. Both v4 and v6 addresses are stored by default

  -i INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
                        Specify the ingress interface for the netdev table
  --no-ipv4             Don't create a set for v4 addresses in the netdev
                        table
  --no-ipv6             Don't create a set for v6 addresses in the netdev
                        table

Logging statement:
  You can optionally add the logging statement to the filtering rules added
  by this script. That way, you'll be able to see the IP addresses of the
  packets that are accepted or dropped by the filtering rules in the kernel
  log (which can be read via the systemd journal or syslog). You can also
  add an optional prefix to the log messages and change the log message
  severity level.

  -p, --log-accept      Add the log statement to the accept filtering rules
  --log-accept-prefix PREFIX
                        Add a prefix to the accept log messages for easier
                        identification. No prefix is used by default.
  --log-accept-level {emerg,alert,crit,err,warn,notice,info,debug}
                        Set the acceptlog message severity level. Default is
                        'warn'.
  -o, --log-drop        Add the log statement to the drop filtering rules
  --log-drop-prefix PREFIX
                        Add a prefix to the drop log messages for easier
                        identification. No prefix is used by default.
  --log-drop-level {emerg,alert,crit,err,warn,notice,info,debug}
                        Set the drop log message severity level. Default is
                        'warn'.

IP Exceptions:
  You can add exceptions for certain IPs by passing a comma separated list
  of IPs or subnets/prefixes to the '--exceptions' option. The IP addresses
  passed to this option will be explicitly allowed in the filtering chain
  created by this script. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be passed. Use
  this option to allow a few IP addresses that would otherwise be denied by
  your filtering sets.

  -e ADDRESSES, --exceptions ADDRESSES
```

# Usage examples
All you have to do is run this script with the appropriate flags. There's no
need to create a table or set manually in your nftables config for the
filtering operation to work.  Take a look at the following examples to
understand how the script works. I'm using the IP address blocks from Monaco in
the following examples:

* Use a netdev table to block packets from Monaco (on the enp1s0 interface)\
  **Command to run**: `nft-geo-filter --table-family netdev --interface enp1s0 MC`\

# Run nft-geo-filter as a service
nft-geo-filter can also be run via a cronjob or a systemd timer to keep your
filtering sets updated. When nft-geo-filter is executed, it will check if the
target sets already exist. It they do, the script will flush the existing
contents of the filtering sets after downloading the IP blocks and then add the
updated IP blocks to the sets. If any changes need to be made to the filtering
rules, the script will make them as well.

* Taking Monaco as an example again, to update the filtering sets in an 'ip'
  table called 'monaco-filter' when you boot your system and then every 12
  hours thereafter, your systemd timer and service units would look something
  like this (provided you have stored the nft-geo-filter script in
  /usr/local/bin):

  **nft-geo-filter.timer**
  ```
  [Unit]
  Description=nftables Country Filter Timer

  [Timer]
  OnBootSec=1min
  OnUnitActiveSec=12h

  [Install]
  WantedBy=timers.target
  ```

  **nft-geo-filter.service**
  ```
  [Unit]
  Description=nftables Country Filter

  [Service]
  Type=oneshot
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/nft-geo-filter --table-family ip --table-name monaco-filter MC
  ```

* A cronjob that runs the same nft-geo-filter command provided above at 3:00 a.m.
  every day would look like this:
  ```
  0 3 * * * /usr/local/bin/nft-geo-filter --table-family ip --table-name monaco-filter MC
  ```

# Using the MaxMind GeoIP data set
MaxMind has [free and paid GeoIP data sets](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data). Note
that you must sign up for an account and follow their EULA. However, the free set [can be used for blocking 
connections by region](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408935918363).

You must download the 'GeoLite2 Country: CSV Format' ZIP file and pass it with `--maxmind-zip` to use
the MaxMind GeoIP data set. When you set up your account you can create a 'License Key' and use that to 
[automate the download](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/updating-databases?lang=en#directly-downloading-databases) of
new ZIP files.

The MaxMind integration supports blocking all European Union member countries. Simply pass `european_union` as one
of the country arguments:
```
nft-geo-filter --provider maxmind --maxmind-zip ./countrycsv.zip --table-family netdev \
               --interface eth0 european_union
```

You can also block IP ranges by continent. Pass `continent_XX` as a country argument, where XX is one of
`AF` (Africa), `AS` (Asia), `EU` (Europe), `OC` (Oceania), `AN` (Antarctica), `NA` (North America),
`SA` (South America). New continents will be added to the list as plate tectonics change.
```
nft-geo-filter --provider maxmind --maxmind-zip ./countrycsv.zip --table-family netdev \
               --interface eth0 continent_AN
```
